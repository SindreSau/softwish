# Softwish

## Project Overview
Softwish is a community-driven platform that bridges the gap between software needs and solutions. It serves as a central hub where developers, users, and organizations can post their software wishes, discover existing solutions, and collaborate on building new tools. The platform aims to eliminate redundant development efforts by connecting those who need software with those who can build it or have already built something similar.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
